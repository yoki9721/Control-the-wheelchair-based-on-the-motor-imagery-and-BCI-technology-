This design helps those who suffer from diseases or lose the ability to walk due to accidents to sit in a wheelchair, operate the wheelchair through consciousness, and move to the position they want. The wheelchair is controlled by collecting the user's imagination that the fingers of his left and right hands point to different directions or different postures of the arms.
